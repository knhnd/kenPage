abstract: In this paper, an evaluation model of credibility calculation system is introduced. This system calculates information credibility by comparing target information with various reliable information resources on World Wide Web. The feature of the method is calculating information credibility by sensor data (earthquake, weather, railway sensors) besides primary sources (government, Ministry, press relation, supporting organization). The information credibility is calculated by degree of objectivity. Therefore, the system integrates high quality data from resources to derive objectivity. This paper presents a model of evaluation for credibility calculation system. The main contribution of this paper is to present evaluation model for credibility calculation system by recall and precision as a degree of false positive and false negative. And this paper shows the feasibility of the model by experiments of recall and precision for credibility calculation system.
