abstract: We herein introduce the matrix node graph data structure and its application for credibility assessment with temporal transition of intention classification. Information that is disseminated on the World Wide Web (WWW) has two meanings. Those are the apparent meaning and the implicit intention. Implicit intention is defined as the purpose of information dissemination. However, the intention of disseminated information cannot be recognized by only examining text. Especially in the case of Fake News, intention is artfully hidden, and the intention will change in the process of the information spreading. The recognition of the intention of information and following its temporal transition are effective to assess the credibility of the information. The matrix node graph structure is a graph that has a matrix as a node. In this data structure, we propose a method to recognize and classify the intention of information by use of an intention matrix while following the temporal transition of intention using a graph structure. By using this structure, the intention and temporal transition of particular information can be derived. This paper shows the feasibility and usefulness of the structure through experiments. An application for credibility assessment is also introduced.
